\begin{enumerate}

\item The technical meeting starts at 10:00 and all players should be present.

\item All games of the tournament will be played with balls of Footvolley Athens
  \textbf{exclusively}.

\item The structure of the games will be groups in the first phase and knock-out
  games from the quarter-/semi-finals. If the number of the teams is very high,
  there will be a
  \href{https://www.printyourbrackets.com/9teamdoubleelimination.html}{double
    elimination tournament bracket}.

\item All games will be one set of 18 points.

\item The classification of the teams in the group is formed based on the
  following criteria in order of priority:

  \begin{enumerate}[i)]
  \item Number of wins
  \item Number of Win(s) in games between two (or more) tied teams
  \item Total points scored-for minus total points scored-against (max.) in the
    games between the tied teams
  \item Total points scored-for (max.) in the games between the tied teams
  \item Draw %ή σετ στα 12 (max. στα 15)
  \end{enumerate}

\item The team that lost the last game should arbitrate the next one. In the end
  of each game, the referees should notify the secretariat of the exact score.

\item The first service of a set is executed by the team determined by the coin
  toss. The same happens in the beginning of the tie-break.

\item The ball may touch any part of the body, except arms and hands.

\item In every play, the team can pass the ball by performing one, two or three
  hits.

\item A player is not allowed to hit the ball two \textit{consecutive} times.

\item Under \textbf{no} circumstances can a player touch the net. This is a
  fault and the referee should register the point to the opponent team.

\item A player may enter into the opponent’s space provided that he doesn't
  touch the net or this does not interfere with the opponent’s play.

\item The ball sent to the opponent’s court must go over the net and between the
  two antennas and their imaginary extension. If the ball crosses the net
  outside this area or hits any of the antennas or anything outside from this
  area, it is considered a fault and the opponent team wins the point.

\item The service zone is an 1m wide area behind the end line. If the service
  hill covers the line, it belongs to the playing field (the whole hill,
  including basement).

\item A player of the serving team must not prevent the opponent, through
  individual screening (e.g. by waving arms, jumping or moving sideways), from
  seeing the server AND the flight path of the ball.

\item If there is any external interference (e.g. a ball from another court
  enters the court) during the game, the play has to be stopped and the rally is
  replayed.

\item A time-out lasts for 1 minute and each team can request a maximum of one
  time-out per set.

\item If one team is not ready to play within 5 minutes from the time it is
  called to proceed in court, it loses the set 15x0 or 18x0 (depending on the
  tournament structure, see previous rule).

\item It is not possible to change a team after the beginning of the tournament.

\item The organization committee retains the right to reject or disqualify
  whoever player or whichever team creates problems that interfere with the
  smooth conduct of the games. Any deficiencies, doubts or problems of the
  present regulations will be analyzed and resolved by the organization
  committee.
