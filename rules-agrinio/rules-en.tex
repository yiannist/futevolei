The tournament will follow the official rules of the European Footvolley League
\cite{EFVL}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The technical meeting will take place on Friday, 21st of September,
   afternoon and all players should be present.

\item The prize money for the best three teams of the tournament is 1400 € for
  the $1^{st}$, 800 € for the $2^{nd}$ and 600 € for the $3^{rd}$.

\item The best eight teams (i.e., all teams that proceed to the quarter-finals)
  receive extra money bonus of 200 €.

\item The players must wear the singlet of the tournament.

\item The players can wear the shorts of the tournament or theirs but they
  should be the same.

\item All games will be played exclusively with the balls of the organization.

\item The top of the net for this tournament (for testing purposes and approved
  by the EFVL) is set at the height of 2.15 m.

\item Twelve (12) teams will participate in the tournament divided in two groups
  of six (6). The best four teams from each group proceed to the quarter-finals.

\item The classification of the teams in the group phase is formed based on the
  following criteria in order of priority:

  \begin{enumerate}[i)]
  \item Number of wins
  \item Number of Win(s) in games between two (or more) tied teams
  \item Total points scored-for minus total points scored-against (max.)
  \item Total points scored-for (max.)
  \item Draw %ή σετ στα 12 (max. στα 15)
  \end{enumerate}

\item All games in the group and the quarter-final phases are comprised of
  \textbf{one} set of 18 points and at most 25 points in case a minimum lead of
  two points is not achieved. The teams switch courts after every 6 points
  played.

\item The semi-finals, the $3^{rd}$-place game and the final are played until
  one team wins two sets. One set is played until one team wins 18 points with a
  minimum lead of two points (\textit{no} maximum points). In the case of a 1-1
  tie, the deciding 3rd set is played to 15 points with a minimum lead of 2
  points. The teams switch courts after every 6 points (set 1 and 2) and 5
  points (set 3) played.

%% \item The first service of a set is executed by the team determined by the coin
%%   toss. The same happens in the beginning of the tie-break.

%% \item The ball may touch any part of the body, except arms and hands.

%% \item A player may enter into the opponent’s space provided that he doesn't
%%   touch the net or this does not interfere with the opponent’s play.

%% \item The service zone is an 1m wide area behind the end line. If the service
%%   hill covers the line, it belongs to the playing field (the whole hill,
%%   including basement).

%% \item A player of the serving team must not prevent the opponent, through
%%   individual screening (e.g. by waving arms, jumping or moving sideways), from
%%   seeing the server AND the flight path of the ball.

%% \item If there is any external interference (e.g. a ball or another object
%%   enters the court) during the game, the play has to be stopped and the rally is
%%   replayed.

\item A time-out can be requested from the quarter-final phase and on. A
  time-out lasts for 60 seconds and each team can request a maximum of one
  time-out per set.

\item For medical purposes (e.g. injury or illness), the referee decides the
  moment and the interval of the interruption.

\item If one team is not ready to play within 5 minutes from the time it is
  called to proceed in court, it loses the set 18x0 (or 15x0 if it is the
  tie-break).

%% \item It is not possible to change a team after the beginning of the tournament.

\item In the playing court, all players should wear clothes provided by the
  organization e.g. usage of a shirt of another tournament or sponsor is
  prohibited. Furthermore, during the award ceremony, all players should wear
  the singlet of the tournament. In other case, they \textbf{automatically} give
  up the money prizes.

\item The organization committee retains the right to reject or disqualify
  whoever player or team creates problems that interfere with the smooth conduct
  of the games. This will automatically mean that the player or team gives up
  all money prizes. Any deficiencies, doubts or problems of the present
  regulations will be analyzed and resolved by the organization committee.
